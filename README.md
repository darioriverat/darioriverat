# Hi :smiley:, I'm Darío

I'm a software developer who is passionate about the web. I love programming with PHP and Laravel.
Often I write articles in my own blog [Pleets](https://blog.pleets.org) (in Spanish). You can check it out to know what I'm doing right now :computer:.

Currently I'm working at [PlacetoPay - Evertec](https://www.placetopay.com/) :office: in Medellín, Colombia.
