### Hi, I'm Darío 👋

😄 I'm a software developer who is passionate about the web. I love programming with PHP and Laravel. Currently I write some articules in my own website <a href="https://blog.pleets.org/">Pleets Blog</a> about the web, PHP, JavaScript, and more.

Such as the 90% of world developers my dream is to a be apart of some 🕹️👾 Game development team and code a game 🤣 sometime in my life.

⚡ I'm a fan of Death Note and other animes. Have you ever seen Death Note ?
