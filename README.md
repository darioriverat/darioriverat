😄 I'm a software developer who is passionate about the web. I love programming with PHP and Laravel. Currently I write some articules in my own website <a href="https://blog.pleets.org/">Pleets Blog</a> about the web, PHP, JavaScript, and more.

I'm working at [Evertec](https://www.placetopay.com/) company in Medellín, Colombia. Do you need a secure payment gateway for your website ? Do not hesitate to call us 👌.

Such as the 90% of world developers my dream is to a be apart of some 🕹️👾 Game development team and code a game 🤣 sometime in my life.

⚡ I'm a fan of Death Note and other animes. Have you ever seen Death Note ?
